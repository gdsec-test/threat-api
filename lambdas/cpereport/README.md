### Slack bot disabled at the moment
- `Security_Threat_Bot` Slack app was associated with this lambda to write to `#threat-research-telemetry` channel
- The app is disabled for now as the lighthouse project is on hold
- https://godaddy.slack.com/apps/A01N6JPG6BD-threat-research?settings=1&tab=settings - the exact slack app
